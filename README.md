# Model-based Testing with Alternating Interface Automata

For documentation, check out this repository locally, and open lattest-lib/docs/index.html (github doesn't render HTML directly in the web-interface).

To compile and test the library, in the lattest-lib folder, run `stack test`.

For examples, see the README.md in the examples folder.
