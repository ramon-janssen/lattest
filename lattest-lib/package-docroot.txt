Welcome to Lattest, the latest attested lattice testing tech!

The purpose of Lattest to assist in model-based testing: set up a test for external systems, where the expected behaviour of that system
is expressed as a specification model in the form of an automaton.

For details on setting up such a test, see "Lattest.Exec.Testing",
