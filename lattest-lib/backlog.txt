unit test example for automata

examples
- examples that use non-determinism / conjunction

resolve compiler warnings

Add adapters
- stdin/stdout
- socket

update Simulator.hs to use new style automata

alphabets
- internal
- input failures
-- also in adapters
- timed
- symbolic
-- use generics to infer random test selection from testing (beware of non-termination with recursive data structures)
--- https://github.com/lysxia/generic-random

error handling in adapter
- some form of exceptions that propagate to test result as "inconclusive"
-- documentation of System.IO.Streams.Attoparsec.parserToInputStream: "Upon a parse error, parserToInputStream will throw a ParseException."

refinement checking

DSL
- grammar
- parsers
- examples

test selection
- n-complete
- test purposes
- fancy combinators to alternate/interleave different selectors/coverage
-- coverage A before coverage B
-- selectors that start with basic tests and then continue with more detailed coverage (e.g. branch coverage -> pairwise coverage)

symbolic specs
- environments, variable mappings
- SMT-solving
- symbolic execution
-- refinement checking

timed things
- ???
