    A /state configuration/ is a type constructor which represents the observable perspective on the state of an automaton. A
    system will internally have a state, but this state can not always be observed or inferred for an external viewer. To model
    the difference between internal and observable state, we define automata as having a type of internal state, say q, and
    an observable state configuration over q.
    
    In this module, we define three such state configurations:
    
    * deterministic state configurations, where every behaviour leads to a single state,
    * non-deterministic state configurations, where given observable behaviour may lead to a set of states, and
    * distributive lattices, or positive boolean formulas, where the observable behaviour is expressed as a logical expression over states.
    
    Here, 'observed behaviour' is formally a trace or sequence of observable actions. Thus, after a trace, the system is
    in a state configuration over states. The state configuration is computed by taking transitions, following the monadic interpret 
    of the state configuration. If the automaton does not exhibit a given trace of actions, then the state configuration after
    that trace is either 'forbidden' or 'underspecified'. Here, 'forbidden' expresses that the automaton does not allow the
    given trace, whereas 'underspecified' expresses that the automaton does not specify the trace, hence the trace is allowed.
